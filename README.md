## Features
- **Real-Time Packet Monitoring**: Efficiently sniff and analyze network packets.
- **Customizable Rules**: Define, parse, and manage rules to detect and mitigate network threats.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Use a blacklist to block malicious IP addresses dynamically.
- **Protocol Support**: Built-in support for multiple protocols with extensible configurations.
- **Radix Tree for Rules**: Optimized rule matching with a radix tree data structure.
- **OpenWRT Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with OpenWRT environments via a shell script.
- **Start/Stop Service Management**: Intuitive service controls with `main.py` and `service_manager.py`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `scapy` for packet sniffing and analysis
- Administrator/root access for managing network configurations
- OpenWRT environment (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Defnet-IDS-IPS.git
   cd Defnet-IDS-IPS
   ```

## Configuration

### 1. Protocol Configuration
Define the supported protocols in `configuration/config_protocols.json`. For example:
```json
{
  "TCP": 6,
  "UDP": 17,
  "ICMP": 1
}
```

### 2. Network Settings
Customize network settings in `configuration/config_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "HOME_NET": "192.168.1.0/24",
  "EXTERNAL_NET": "any"
}
```

### 3. Rules
Define your detection and prevention rules in `rules/config_rules.json`. Example:
```json
{
  "rule_id": "1",
  "protocol": "ICMP",
  "src_ip": "any",
  "dst_ip": "any",
  "action": "alert",
  "description": "ICMP packet detection",
  "threshold": {
    "count": 1,
    "time": 10
  },
  "flags":"S"
}
```

## Usage

### Starting the Service
Use the main script to start or stop the IDS/IPS service:
```bash
python main.py start
```

### Stopping the Service
```bash
python main.py stop
```

### OpenWRT Integration - Start/Stop Service 
Use the shell script to manage the service in an OpenWRT environment:
```bash
./openwrt-ids-ips.sh start
./openwrt-ids-ips.sh stop
```
